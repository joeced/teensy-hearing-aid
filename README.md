# Teensy Hearing Aid

Inspired by http://openaudio.blogspot.com/2016/11/a-teensy-hearing-aid.html, I
created this repository to work on simple hearing aid algorithms on a Teensy
3.6 with the AudioShield rev. C.

I use VS Code with the PlatformIO extension to build the projects. In each
subfolder there is an individual algorithm to work on.
